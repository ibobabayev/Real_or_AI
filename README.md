# Real_or_AI
This project utilizes FastAI to develop a model that classifies images as either Real or AI-Generated. 
The goal is to distinguish between real photographs and images created by artificial intelligence.
For this project, I used the "Detect AI-Generated Faces: High Quality Dataset" from Kaggle, which consists of a collection of high-quality images of faces that are either real or AI-generated.
This dataset was crucial in training the model to classify images based on their authenticity.
